Implements Gumbel Softmax VAE for Semi Supervised Learning.

From: http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01144

Repo Structure from: https://github.com/jxmorris12/vec2text/
- NLP repos are smartly organized. Could be useful to adapt them for statistical ML purposes.

Additional experiments.
- What if we replace VAE loss with Contrastive Divergence Loss from: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04062
